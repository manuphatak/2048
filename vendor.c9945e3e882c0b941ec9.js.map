For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n     * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n     *\n     *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n     *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n     *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n     *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n     *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n     *\n     * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n     * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n     *\n     * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n     * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n     *\n     * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n     * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n     * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n     *\n     *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n     *\n     * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n     * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n     * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n     *\n     * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n     * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n     * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n     * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n     *\n     *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n     *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n     *     }\n     *\n     * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n     *\n     */\n    function is(valueA, valueB) {\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n      if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n          typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n        valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n        valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n        if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n          return true;\n        }\n        if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n          return false;\n        }\n      }\n      if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n          typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n          valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      return false;\n    }\n  \n    function deepEqual(a, b) {\n      if (a === b) {\n        return true;\n      }\n  \n      if (\n        !isIterable(b) ||\n        a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n        a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n        isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n        isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n        isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n      ) {\n        return false;\n      }\n  \n      if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n        return true;\n      }\n  \n      var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n  \n      if (isOrdered(a)) {\n        var entries = a.entries();\n        return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n          var entry = entries.next().value;\n          return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n        }) && entries.next().done;\n      }\n  \n      var flipped = false;\n  \n      if (a.size === undefined) {\n        if (b.size === undefined) {\n          if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n            a.cacheResult();\n          }\n        } else {\n          flipped = true;\n          var _ = a;\n          a = b;\n          b = _;\n        }\n      }\n  \n      var allEqual = true;\n      var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n        if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n            flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n          allEqual = false;\n          return false;\n        }\n      });\n  \n      return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n    }\n  \n    createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n  \n      function Repeat(value, times) {\n        if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n          return new Repeat(value, times);\n        }\n        this._value = value;\n        this.size = times === undefined ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.
